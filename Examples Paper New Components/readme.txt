These scripts check wether the examples constructed in the
paper

	"New Solutions of the Poincare Center Problem in Degree 3"

really satisfy all the conditions claimed in the paper.

I moved these examples here from

	svn/macaulay-scripts/darbouxSteiner

the scripts that found these examples and constructed them
are still in that directory
